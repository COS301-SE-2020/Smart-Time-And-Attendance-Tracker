## Introduction
STAT is a web and desktop application that allows people to track time and attendance based on what they are currently working on. With the use of the latest innovations in AI, IOT, and mobile platforms, we are allowing people to improve the hours in which they are productive while freeing up time for them to relax, all at the tap of a button.

## Features
**Automatic Tracking**\
STAT makes it easy track time spent on activities via the dashboard and using hot keys. STAT will record the total time spent on these activities.

**Google Chrome plug-in**\
Automatic tracking is even easier with the STAT plug-in, which automatically starts tracking when you open your browser. All you have to do is classify the entry so that STAT knows where to put it.

**Manual Tracking**\
Prefer the pen and paper method? No problem. Track your time and monetary expenditure any way you like and simply use those details to create a time entry.

**Calendar Syncing**\
STAT tracks your time and attendance using your calendar entries. No need to worry about recording events in more than one place. STAT will retrieve the data from your calendar and automatically record the relevant time data.

**IOT Integration**\
You can use STAT almost anywhere. STAT is designed to work with external devices like cameras to help you track time and attendance more efficiently. Simply connect your IOT device to the system and STAT will receive time and attendance data from the device, and track your time accordingly.

**Predictive Analysis**\
STAT produces graphs that allow you to view how time was spent during the course of a project and help to manage your team better. Using historical data, STAT can estimate how many hours you will log in the coming week.

**Project Management**\
You can manage your projects, tasks, and teams. STAT's dashboard makes it easy to see upcoming due dates, tracking history, and overdue tasks and projects.

**Organisation Management**\
Authentication requests are automatically sent to your administrator each time a new user registers, which allows you to control who has access to your system by accepting and rejecting requests. You can also control what information and functionality each user has using STAT's role assignment functionality.

**Import/Export Functionality**\
STAT accepts tracking data in various formats so you can track how you spend your time any way you want. When you import CSV or JSON data, STAT automatically creates the time entries for you. You can even export all of your tracking data to a JSON, CVS, or PDF file.
